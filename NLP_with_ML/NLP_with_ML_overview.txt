Common NLP tasks are often solved using traditional NLP methods such as simple 
rules-based techniques or more advanced ML algorithms

Commmon NLP tasks include Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Topic Modelling


SA - techniques used to solve this task are Rules-based, the library is VADER and the input is raw Text

TC - Supervised learning (i.e., Naive Bayes), library is scikit-learn, input format CV / TF-IDF

TM - Unsupervised Learning (i.e., NMF) library is scikit-learn, input format CV / TF-IDF



Traditional vs Modern NLP

Traditional techniques include ML algorithms, Modern techniques include Deep Learning techniques.
If the goal is one of SA, TC, or TM and the data is relatively small (<100k rows) then we can use tradittional techniques, if we have big data (>1M rows) then we may consider modern techniques
If the goal is little complex such as Text Generation, Machine Translation, Question Answering which can not be done with traditional techniques then we should opt for modern techniques.
