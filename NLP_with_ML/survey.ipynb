Moreover, there is a problem with the grading system. She would divide a 5-point quiz into 2.5 and make us write it, simply under the name of quiz we had video analyses of 2 books. Additionally, this 5 points was also evaluated as our activity grade. How correct is it to evaluate 5 points as both activity and as 2 quizzes worth 2.5 points each? / She is so unscrupulous. She basically cut everyone's grades in the group. This is the first time I've seen such a thing at Khazar. This teacher was literally eating our rights. She might be the reason I fail to graduate if my grade is cut. Despite how much we suffered, she gave our grades at the minimum level. There was no trace of justice. I don't understand how a teacher creating such injustice exists at a university like Khazar. My rights from her are not forgiven. / She is a good teacher, just need to say that we are not high school students, we are university students and our lessons are not only from her subject... in short, there is no need for so much workload. / Good teacher, just teaches the lesson monotonously / she s really great as a teacher but she has that clear accent which cannot be accepted and overall her level of english is not that good which seemed a bit wrong for me bcs i know english better than her and its noticable enough. as an instuctor she has to be advanced / taught the lessons well / Average / The Best Teacher!!! <3 / Good teacher / THE MOST CRUEL TEACHER I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, I WILL NEVER EVER TAKE THE SUBJECT SHE TEACHES AGAIN, THE WORST TEACHER OF THIS SEMESTER / Valid teacher is a very knowledgeable teacher, engages everyone in the lesson but gives too much material and I think there was a bit of a problem with giving grades. also in the exam system, unlike other teachers' groups, we got a more difficult version. meaning in the definition task, normally we would see both the word itself and the definition matching it, but in our group we had to think of and find the word matching the definition ourselves and I think there was injustice regarding our group. The other group got the words themselves. / Knowledgeable teacher but it is very difficult to get along with this teacher. If you are not a favorite student, she doesn't want to listen to you / Her facial expressions could be more understandable when listening to children. Sometimes it makes us hesitate / I don't know how correct it is to give 3 project works, make 2 quizzes (2.5 points) under activity grade and force us to read 2 books for each one. When she gives so many assignments, neither can we deliver nor can she allocate time for grading. / behaved very unfairly / Excellent /\",\n",

In my opinion, her command of English, her ability to explain, conducting fair grading, making us feel like we are in some conversation club rather than in class during the lesson, meaning creating that environment and so on, in one word she was irreplaceable.

       "3    Knowledgeable teacher. / In my opinion, the teacher needs to understand that our lessons are not only from her subject. Moreover, there is a problem with the grading system. She would divide a 5-point quiz into 2.5 and make us write it, simply under the name of quiz we had video analyses of 2 books. Additionally, this 5 points was also evaluated as our activity grade. How correct is it to evaluate 5 points as both activity and as 2 quizzes worth 2.5 points each? / She is so unscrupulous. She basically cut everyone's grades in the group. This is the first time I've seen such a thing at Khazar. This teacher was literally eating our rights. She might be the reason I fail to graduate if my grade is cut. Despite how much we suffered, she gave our grades at the minimum level. There was no trace of justice. I don't understand how a teacher creating such injustice exists at a university like Khazar. My rights from her are not forgiven. / She is a good teacher, just need to say that we are not high school students, we are university students and our lessons are not only from her subject... in short, there is no need for so much workload. / Good teacher, just teaches the lesson monotonously / she s really great as a teacher but she has that clear accent which cannot be accepted and overall her level of english is not that good which seemed a bit wrong for me bcs i know english better than her and its noticable enough. as an instuctor she has to be advanced / taught the lessons well / Average / The Best Teacher!!! <3 / Good teacher / THE MOST CRUEL TEACHER I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, I WILL NEVER EVER TAKE THE SUBJECT SHE TEACHES AGAIN, THE WORST TEACHER OF THIS SEMESTER / Valid teacher is a very knowledgeable teacher, engages everyone in the lesson but gives too much material and I think there was a bit of a problem with giving grades. also in the exam system, unlike other teachers' groups, we got a more difficult version. meaning in the definition task, normally we would see both the word itself and the definition matching it, but in our group we had to think of and find the word matching the definition ourselves and I think there was injustice regarding our group. The other group got the words themselves. / Knowledgeable teacher but it is very difficult to get along with this teacher. If you are not a favorite student, she doesn't want to listen to you / Her facial expressions could be more understandable when listening to children. Sometimes it makes us hesitate / I don't know how correct it is to give 3 project works, make 2 quizzes (2.5 points) under activity grade and force us to read 2 books for each one. When she gives so many assignments, neither can we deliver nor can she allocate time for grading. / behaved very unfairly / Excellent /\n",

In my opinion, her command of English, her ability to explain, conducting fair grading, making us feel like we are in some conversation club rather than in class during the lesson, meaning creating that environment and so on, in one word she was irreplaceable. Meaning normally during the semester the subject I complain about the most is English, but this semester it was definitely not like that. Thank you?????? / Thank you for everything! /\n",
